Mantras By James
----------------
- "Practice is the best of all instructors." - computation requires practice 
- "An agreeable companion on a journey is as good as a carriage." - look to your classmates for help too 
- "While we stop to think, we often miss our opportunity." - sometimes you need to take a leap of faith 
- "When two do the same thing, it is not the same thing after all." - encourage students with similar ideas 
- "The bow too tensely strung is easily broken." - don't get too stressed out 
- All of these are from Plubius Syrus.(42 B.C.)
